# Unhandled Database Errors in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: inadequate error handling for database queries within route handlers. The `bug.js` file showcases the flawed implementation, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

## Problem

The original code lacks error handling for database connection issues or query failures.  If the database query fails for any reason other than a missing user, the server will likely crash or return a generic error message, which is not helpful for debugging or providing a user-friendly response.

## Solution

The solution implements a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors during database operations.  Specific error codes are returned to the client, providing more context to the error.  Error logging is also added to aid in debugging.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the flawed code: `node bug.js` (observe the behavior)
4. Run the corrected code: `node bugSolution.js` (observe the improved behavior)

This example uses a placeholder database query.  Adapt it to your specific database and query mechanism.
